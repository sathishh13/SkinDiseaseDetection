# Major Project : A Deep Learning Approach for Automated prognosis for Skin Disease Detection
     The aim is to introduce a deep learning approach for the automated prognosis of skin diseases, 
leveraging image analysis techniques. The methodology integrates diverse deep learning 
strategies to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of skin disease prognosis. By combining 
various neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
achieves a comprehensive analysis of medical images. The incorporation of advanced image 
analysis techniques aims to provide a robust and reliable prognosis system. The effectiveness 
of the proposed deep learning approach is evaluated through rigorous experimentation, 
demonstrating its potential as an innovative solution for automated skin disease prognosis 
based on image data.
